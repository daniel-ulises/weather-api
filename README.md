# Simple WeatherApp

This is a really simple weather app that I have created as an assingment for my class using React and the OpenWeather API. It has an automatic geolocation when you first launch it to detect where you are, but if you have it disabled in your browser you will have to search for a location manually. 


# Test it locally

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```npm i```

Once you have installed them, you will have to add your own API key which you can get for free at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). If you already have one, just edit the **App.jsx** and replace **${process.env.REACT_APP_KEY}** with it.


# Live demo

You can see it live [here](https://daniel-ulises.github.io/weather-app).
